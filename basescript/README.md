# Base Scripts 

Some handy scripts to make your life easier. 

## Thoughts

The scripts was designed thinking of a few baselines:

- Simplicity
- Reusability
- Meaningful reading

and the Unix concept of DOTADIW:
- Do One Thing And Do It Well

## Versioning

Every change should be non breakable, if it worked for you in some *main version* it should continue to work in all corrections and new functions.

Versioning: v**X.Y**

'X': main version

'Y': corrections / new functions

## Documentation

There will be a specific page for documentation and samples of every function in this repo.
